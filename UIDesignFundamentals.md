# UI Design Fundamentals

## White Space
Its the empty space of the User Interface. White Space should be applied based on the following four factors:
- ### space availability
  Depends on the viewport size of the user's device.
- ### number of components
  The fewer components the more white space you can have.
- ### alignment
  The white space needs to support the chosen alignment.
- ### consistency
  White Space should be applied similar throughout the design.

## Contrast
Helps seperate elements from each other by adjusting color, brightness and/or opacity. Contrast should be applied based on two factors:
- ### Is it type? If so, is it text that needs to be read?
  - #### How large is the type?
    #### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:
    - Small Text(AA) Ratio of at least 4.5:1
    - Small Text(AAA) Ratio of at least 7:1
    - Large Text(AA) Ratio of at least 3:1
    - Large Text(AAA) Ratio of at least 4.5:1  
    #### Large Text is defined as 14 point and bold or larger or 18 point and not bold or larger
    
- ### If it's not type, is it an important visual element?

## Scale
The following considerations have to be made:
- ### Should it be readable?
  - Paragraph text should be no smaller than 16px
  - Adjust type scale to reinforect the visual hierarchy
- ### How much space is available?

## Alignment
Provides structure and flow to a layout.
- Don't mix central with left or right alignment

## Color
It is the skin of the UI. It has the most potential to make or break the UI.
- ### Color terminoloy
  - #### Hue
    A color with full color saggeration
  - #### Tint
    Light added to a color
  - #### Shade
    Darkness added to a color
  - #### Tone
    Grey added to a color
- ### Color Schemes
  Recurring colors throughout a UI
  - Use no more than 3 hues
  - Usually have a primary, secondary and an accent color
  - #### Types of Schemes
    - Monochromatic  
      One hue with various tints, shades and tones.
    - Analogous  
      Multiple hues located next to each other in the color spectrum
    - Complementary
      Hues that are located opposite of each other on the color wheel
- ### Colors have meaning
  They invoke certain emotional responses(like red for warning)
  - ### Meaning often depends on target demographic, on their
    - culture
    - age 
    - gender

## Typography
- ### Tracking(space between letters)
  - Widet Tracking is typically used on titles, labels & watermarks
  - Stick with default tracking in most cases
  - Wide Tracking can make text difficult to read
- ### Leading(space between lines of text)
  - Use consistant leading among similar elements
- ### Font styles(serif, sans serif, script)
  - sans serif is mostly used
  - serif fonts are seen as professional, authoratative, old-timeoush
  - serif and sans serif can be mixed
  - you should not mix to many typefaces
  - if mixed typefaces should be similar
- ### Font weight
  - important for establishing visual hierarchy
  - Do not make too many words bold

## Visual Hierarchy
Using other design fundamentals to give priority to elements in the UI
